# Lockboxes

## Description

This project solves the **Lockboxes** problem using Python. The goal is to determine if all the boxes in a list can be opened starting from the first box (box `0`).

Each box may contain keys to other boxes. You can only open a box if you have its corresponding key. The challenge is to traverse through the keys efficiently and determine whether all boxes can be unlocked.
